> A curated list of pointless yet funny websites

Welcome to the most useless place on Github.

Here you will find an extensive list of useless (and funny) websites. I knew about some of them, some of them were told to me by friends. I decided that I want more so I started googling random stuff, and that’s how I got the rest. But, believe me, the internet is full of way more useless stuff than this.
